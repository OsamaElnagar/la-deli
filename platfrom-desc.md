ðŸ“¦ System Overview â€“ Internal Delivery & Operations Management System for a Pharmacy Chain
ðŸŽ¯ Main Objective of the System:
The primary goal is to enhance operational efficiency across branches, pharmacies, warehouses, and delivery agents by:
* Ensuring proper tracking and confirmation of every step in the process.
* Digitizing all paperwork and operations.
* Making invoices easily accessible and trackable.
* Providing visibility over who prepared, received, and delivered each order.
ðŸ‘¤ System Actors:
1. Pharmacist:
* Receives a notification when thereâ€™s a new order to prepare.
* Views the invoice (as PDF or similar).
* Prepares the order and confirms the action inside the system.
* The order is then handed over either for delivery or for transfer to another pharmacy or branch.
2. Feeder (Data Entry Role):
* Responsible for feeding invoices into the system.
* Defines the source and destination (branch â†’ branch, branch â†’ store, store â†’ branch, etc.).
* Assigns a unique code to each invoice for tracking purposes.
* The role is purely data entry and setup â€” not involved in physical handling.
3. Delivery Agent (Driver):
* Receives notifications for orders that are ready to be picked up.
* Can be in one of three states:
   * Online: Available for delivery tasks.
   * Busy: Already delivering an existing order.
   * Offline: Not available.
* When available, they:
   * Confirm pickup from the pharmacy or branch.
   * Confirm delivery to the final destination (another branch or home).
   * Each confirmation is logged within the system.
4. End Customer:
* Not involved with the system.
* The platform is purely for internal operations and is invisible to customers.
ðŸ“² Core System Features:
* Instant notifications to relevant users (pharmacists, drivers).
* Invoice generation with unique codes for tracking.
* Full digital workflow â€” no paper usage.
* Step-by-step confirmations for every operation (prepare, pickup, deliver).
* Ability to monitor who did what, when, and where.

* Complete digital trail and reporting for management.
ðŸ§  Additional Suggestions / Potential Enhancements:
* Admin dashboard to view real-time order statuses.
* Activity logs for all users.
* Role-based access and permissions.
* Exportable reports (PDF, Excel).
* Future API integrations or mobile extensions for delivery agents.
